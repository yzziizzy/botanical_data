Organized Botanical Data

Mankind has collect much informatino about plants. Sadly, it is widely dispersed and seldom machine readable. This project aims to address both problems.

Emphasis is placed on useful plants, especially edibles. Useless data is omitted on purpose. If you're looking for an academia circle-jerk with more citations than actual information, google is full of them. Not here. Just plants, just data. Are some uberbotanists in an argument over where some obscure plant goes in some taxonomy? Don't care; I'll call it something and list the data because that's all that matters.
