Organized Botanical Data

Mankind has collected much information about plants. Sadly, it is widely dispersed and seldom machine readable. This project aims to address both problems.

Emphasis is placed on useful plants, especially edibles. Useless data is omitted on purpose. If you're looking for an academic circle-jerk with more citations than actual information, google is full of them. Not here. Just plants, just data. Are a few uberbotanists in an argument over where some obscure plant goes in some grad student's pet taxonomy? Don't care; I'll call it something and list the data because that's all that matters.
